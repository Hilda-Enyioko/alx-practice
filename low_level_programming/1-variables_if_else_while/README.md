# PROJECT 2:

This project focuses on uses of different types of variables, if conditionals and while loops.

##CONTENT:

**TASK 0** :  assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print whether the number stored in the variable n is positive or negative.
    -FILE: 0-positive_or_negative.c
    
**TASK 1** : assign a random number to the variable n each time it is executed. Complete the source code in order to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable n
    -FILE: 1-last_digit.c
    
**TASK 2** : prints the alphabet in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    -FILE: 2-print_alphabet.c
    
**TASK 3** :  prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase, followed by a new line.
    -FILE: 3-prints_alphabet.c
    
**TASK 4** : prints the alphabet(EXCEPT q and e) in lowercase, followed by a new line
   -FILE: 4-print_alphabt.c
   
**TASK 5** : prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line.
   -FILE: 5-print_numbers.c

**TASK 6** : prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0, followed by a new line
    -FILE: 6-print_numberz.c
    
**TASK 7** : prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse, followed by a new linE
    -FILE: 7-print_tebahpla.c
    
**TASK 8** : prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    -FILE: 8-print_base16.c
    
**TASK 9** : prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
    -FILE: 9-print_comb.c
